DESC: My first entry for a Ludum Dare.
THEME: You are the villain!
CONCEPT: You play as the British weather, a villain any Englishman should know well. 
         You must rain on, thunderstorm and blow over the festival goers to make sure
         that they have the worst time possible. But don't scare them off! You can't
         have any fun if you have no-one's day to ruin.
